---

### Purpose:

* Create a comfortable and generic bash experience

* Enable customizability for specific applications
  - Note: some default functionaliy has been in accordance to macOS

### Notes

* Using `.bash_settings` to neatly store all extra configuration files

* Last updated 22/06/2021

* The files are made ontop of a provided dotfile package but have been cleaned up with additional comments on how to increase performance

* Since macOS is set to use Bash version 3, the shebang `#!/usr/local/bin/bash` has been set to Bash 5
  - For linux users or macOS users that have their main bash at `/bin/bash` change the shebang to `#!/bin/bash`
